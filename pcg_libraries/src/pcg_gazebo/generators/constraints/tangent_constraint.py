    """Class that allows computation of the closes position
    for a model regarding a reference to have it placed tangent
    to the reference.

    The input reference types that are supported are

    * `plane`:

    To set a reference plane to which models will be placed tangently, 
    the `reference` input must be provided as

    ```python
    reference = dict(
        type='plane',
        args=dict(
            normal=[0, 0, 1], # A 3 element unit vector normal to the plane
            origin=[0, 0, 0]  # The 3D position of the origin of the plane
            )
    )
